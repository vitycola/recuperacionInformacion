“Visceral, stunning and relentless film making. Dicaprio's Herculean, almost
purely physical performance and Hardy's wide eyed intensity coupled with the almost
overwhelming beauty of the landscape - those trees, the natural light, the sun peeking
through the clouds, rendered the proceedings down to savage poetry. A hypnotic,
beautiful, exhausting film.”
“I saw this film on Friday. For the first 40 minutes involving spoken dialogue
they need not have bothered. For me the dialogue was totally unintelligible with
grunting, southern states drawl, and coarse accent that made it impossible to
understand what they were saying.”
“It was an idiotic film that produces a magnificent fascination.”
